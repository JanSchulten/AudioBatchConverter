# AudioBatchConverter

This is a free audio converter that can quickly pitch audio files up or down in batches.
It was originally designed to address the storage limitations of certain samplers (such as the TE KOII).

The program allows you to load entire folders, set the pitch/speed, bitrate, sample rate, stereo/mono mode, and output format.

To load a folder, simply drag and drop it into the main window, or use the Input Folder button.
You can change your output folder with the Change button.
Once you press Start, all audio files in the list will be processed.
